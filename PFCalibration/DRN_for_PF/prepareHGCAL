PROGRAM TO SETUP HGCAL TESTBEAM DATA FOR USE IN DRN FRAMEWORK
Simon Rothman; July 14, 2021

The framework I've writted for the DRN expects data to have been extracted from the relevant nTuple,
cleaned up as necessary, and stored as pickle objects. 
This is much faster than skimming the .root file every time you run anything.

This is a simple script which reads the nTuple and generates the necessary .pickle files. 
It need only be run once for a given .root file. If multiple .root files are needed, you 
can either merge them before running this script, or run this script multiple times,
extracting each into a different location. The resulting .pickle files will then contain
awkward arrays (or python lists in the case of cartfeat.pickle) which can be concatenated. 
It would not be difficult to write parsing code to go over multiple root files, but I have 
not done so

The nTuple processing is wrapped in Extract.py; 
only the constructor and the readHGCAL() method are relevant
